# AgriEye
AgriEye is a cost educational drone, for monitoring farms.
It can be flown manually with a control or set to fly on its own.
This drone uses sensors to stay stable and find its way
It helps students learn about robotics, coding and autonomous systems in an peaceful environment.
The AgriEye drone teaches these skills in a real world setting without any risk.
and ive been wanting to make this project for a while now
