# AgriEye – Hack Club Project Proposal

## Student
Ahnaf Tahmid

## Project Name
AgriEye

## Project Description
AgriEye is a low-cost, educational fixed-wing UAV designed for agricultural field monitoring.
The goal is to help students learn robotics, embedded systems, and autonomous navigation
while exploring real-world applications in sustainable farming.

The UAV supports two flight modes:
- Manual RC mode for safety, takeoff, and landing
- Autonomous mode for waypoint-based field monitoring

The project focuses on safe, civilian, and educational use only.

## Why This Project Matters
Many agricultural monitoring systems are expensive and inaccessible.
AgriEye aims to demonstrate how affordable hardware and open-source software
can be used to build practical tools for agriculture and learning.

## Technical Stack
- Raspberry Pi (main controller)
- Python-based flight logic
- IMU and GPS (planned)
- Modular software architecture
- Safety-first design with manual override

## Current Progress
- GitHub repository created
- Software architecture designed
- Manual and autonomous logic simulated
- Safety system implemented

## Future Plans
- Integrate real sensor data
- Improve autonomous navigation
- Add data logging for crop analysis
- Test in controlled environments

## Open Source
AgriEye is open-source and licensed under the MIT License.
