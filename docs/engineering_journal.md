# AgriEye – Engineering Journal

## Day 1 – Project Setup
**What I did:**
- Created the AgriEye GitHub repository
- Learned basic GitHub concepts (folders, commits)
- Added README and MIT License

**What I learned:**
- GitHub is used to track changes and document projects
- Open-source projects need clear structure

**Problems:**
- I was completely new to GitHub at first

**Next steps:**
- Add basic code structure

---

## Day 2 – Software Architecture
**What I did:**
- Created code, hardware, and docs folders
- Added starter Python files for flight logic
- Implemented manual and autonomous modes

**What I learned:**
- Large projects are split into modules
- Manual override is critical for safety

**Problems:**
- Understanding how files connect together

**Next steps:**
- Add safety systems

---

## Day 3 – Safety & Obstacle Avoidance
**What I did:**
- Added battery and RC signal safety checks
- Implemented obstacle avoidance logic (simulated)

**What I learned:**
- Safety must be checked before autonomy
- Obstacle avoidance runs continuously

**Problems:**
- Designing logic without real sensors

**Next steps:**
- Add AI-based monitoring

---

## Day 4 – AI Vision & Data Logging
**What I did:**
- Added simulated AI vision system
- Logged flight and AI data to CSV files

**What I learned:**
- AI pipelines can be tested without real cameras
- Data logging is important for analysis

**Problems:**
- Understanding what data is useful to log

**Next steps:**
- Add telemetry system

---

## Day 5 – Telemetry & Ground Control
**What I did:**
- Implemented live telemetry simulation
- Displayed altitude, speed, battery, and waypoint data

**What I learned:**
- Telemetry helps monitor UAV health
- Ground stations are essential for autonomous systems

**Problems:**
- Making telemetry readable

**Next steps:**
- Plan real hardware integration

---

## Reflection
This project helped me understand how real UAV systems are designed using
modular software, safety-first logic, and documentation.
